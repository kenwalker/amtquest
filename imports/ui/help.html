        <h3>What is AmtQuest?</h3>
        <img class="pure-img centeredimage" src="/images/AmtQuestChest.JPG">
        <br>
        AmtQuest is a quest to have a small wooden chest travel the lands of Amtgard.<br>
        The <a id="guardians" href="#">Guardians</a> are the
        caretakers and take the chest from park to event, handing it off to another willing participant in the long chain of Guardians to take this chest throughout Amtgard.<br>
        When the chest is brought to a park or event, the Guardian opens up the chest and follows the simple instructions.<br>
        The location of the chest, through the power of Amtgard magic, is sent from the chest to this application.  If the location of the chest is close enough to an Amtgard park within the Ork, it is automatically set to have been visited by the AmtQuest chest.<br>
        <img class="pure-img centeredimage" src="/images/FelfrostTag.JPG"><br>
        The <a id="home" href="#">Home</a> page shows all the places the chest has traveled.  If a tagged location is unknown, please use your Facebook account to login and edit the description of the event.<br>
        In addition, please take a photo of the Chest with your park or event participants and post it on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amtquest/" target="_blank">AmtQuest Facebook page</a>.<br>
        This site can do many other things like look for Amtgard parks by name<br>
        <img class="pure-img centeredimage" src="/images/Bloodwyrm.gif"><br><br>
        It can also do a city search and show the Amtgard parks near that city.

        By default it will open on your location if you grant it access (that's all the access is used for).
        <h3>Do you have the Chest?</h3>
        If you haven't already, go to the <a id="guardians" href="#">Guardians</a> page, login with your Facebook account and claim ownership.<br>
        Please keep the Chest dry, away from very hot places and handle with moderate care.  It does contain electronics. Also, don't go digging around inside the electronics ;-)<br>

        Take it to your park or event as described above and tag the location following the instructions on the inside of the chest. Depending on the last time it was used it might take up to 5 minutes to aquire the current location (the green light).<br>
        If there is no cell phone reception where you are, the blue light might never go out. Sorry, you won't be able to tag this location.<br>
        If the yellow light continues to flash while the Chest is operating, please follow the charging instructions on the inside. Remember that the switch needs to be turned on and the device needs to be plugged into a USB power source to charge.  The yellow light should eventually turn solid.  Turn off the switch, unplug the USB and tuck it neatly into the lid carefully using the small clips.  The battery should last a very long time once charged.<br>
